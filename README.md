Matasano (now NCC Group) crypto challenges' (https://cryptopals.com) solutions

Briefly these are a collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world cryptography.
The exercises are derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic
constructions covering topics from symmetric ciphers such as AES (in a variety of modes), padding
schemes such as PKCS#7, random number generators, hashing algorithmns, asymmetric ciphers such as
DSA and RSA, a variety of famous attacks, and so on.
